    descriptionAsHTML:
      value: "<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>\n<p>The goal of this mod is to
        create a longer, more interesting, and realistic end game experience with
        the addition of new technologies and military units and tweaks to existing
        unit strength, production, and pollution to keep it overall balanced. I tried
        to make this mod as compatible as possible with other mods by putting most
        new units and bonuses spread over the new Technologies, and no changes to
        any cultures, or civics. The new Technologies also help to make the Industrial
        and Contemporary Era last significantly longer, especially the late Industrial
        and early Contemporary era (WW1/WW2) period with 12 new technologies.</p>\n<p><strong>Nuclear
        Proliferation:</strong></p>\n<p>Nuclear weapons have become more useful (with
        increased range) and accessible (with reduced minimum strategic resource
        requirements) and with the addition of a true ICBM weapon (unlocked after
        researching Rocket Science and developing Thermal Nuclear Weapons) making
        it more likely they are built and actually used by the AI with devastating
        effects. The state of Nuclear weapons proliferation is made more intuitive
        as the National Nuclear Weapon Test Programs strategic resource requirements
        are made the same as the missile weapons they unlock, meaning if someone
        manages to build a nuclear weapon test project (including ICBM weapon test),
        they can also build and use them (given they also constructed a Missile Silo).</p>\n<p><strong>Science:</strong></p>\n<p>In
        order to create a more historically accurate experience, it was necessary
        to restructure the tech tree with separate branches starting at the end of
        the industrial era. Starting from the modern age the minimum research cost
        increases up to double the cost for the end game technologies. The final
        <span style=\"font-size: 1em; font-weight: 400;\">research cost depends inversely
        on the number of unlocked technologies, meaning the more technologies you
        have unlocked from a previous technology generation, the relatively easier
        it becomes to research additional technologies. This mechanic makes beelining
        technologies (skipping technologies) excessively expansive and the most economical
        way to unlock the entire tech tree is to always choose the cheapest unlockable
        technologies. These changes and the introduction of 21 new technologies have
        the effect of creating a significantly longer end game and it is therefore
        recommended you disable the turn limit when creating a new game.<br></span></p>\n<p><em>New

        naval, land, and air units have been added and existing units are tweaked
        to achieve a longer more satisfying end game experience. The naval unit's
        role progressively gets more important as the era advances with longer attack
        and bombardment ranges. Combat has been been made more interesting with new
        rock scissor paper mechanics between the classes. For example, Submarines
        are more effective versus Battleship, Destroyers are more effective versus
        Submarines and Battleship are more effective versus Destroyers. <span style=\"font-size:
        1em; font-weight: 400;\">Classes now progress through identifiable WW1, WW2,
        Cold War en Stealth era generation, making it feel more historically accurate.
        The early (WW1) units have reduced strategic resource requirements, making
        them more likely to appear in combat. <br></span></p>\n<p>While maintaining
        a minimum strategic resource requirement, Unitcost is no longer fixed but
        depends on the excess availability of strategic resources. This means that
        units will be more accessible and will be easier to upgrade, but at increased
        construction cost or gold price (up to double the base cost).</p>\n<p><em>New
