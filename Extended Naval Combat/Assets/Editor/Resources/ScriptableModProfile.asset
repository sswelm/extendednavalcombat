      value: '<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>

        <p>The goal of this
        mod is to create a longer, more interesting, and realistic end game experience
        with the addition of new technologies and military units and tweaks to existing
        units to keep it overal balanced. I tried to make this mod as compatible
        as possible with other mods by putting most new units and bonuses spread
        over the new Technologies, and no changes to any cultures, or civics. The
        new Technologies also help to make the Industrial and Contemporary Era last
        significantly longer, especially the late Industrial and early Contemporary
        era (WW1/WW2) period with 12 new technologies.</p>

        <p><strong>Nuclear
        Proliferation:</strong></p>

        <p>Nuclear weapons have become more
        useful (with increased range) and accessible (with reduced strategic resource
        requirement) and with the addition of a true ICBM weapon (unlocked after
        ICBM Test) making it more likely they are built and actually used by the
        AI with devistating effects. The state of Nuclear weapons proliferation is
        made more intuitive as the National Nuclear Weapon Test Programs strategic
        resource requirements are made the same as the missile weapons they unlock,
        meaning if someone manages to build a nuclear weapon test project (including
        ICBM weapon test), they can also build and use them (given they also constructed
        a Missile Silo).</p>

        <p><strong>Science:</strong></p>

        <p>In
        order to create a more historically accurate experience, it was necessary
        to restructure the tech tree with separate branches starting at the end of
        the industrial era. To help get a more natural progression, starting from
        the modern age the minimum research cost increases up to double the cost
        for the end game technologies. The final <span style="font-size: 1em; font-weight:
        400;">research cost depends inversely on the number of unlocked technologies,
        meaning the more technologies you have unlocked from a previous technology
        generation, the relatively easier it becomes to research additional technologies.
        This mechanic makes beelining technologies (skipping technologies) excessively
        expansive and the most economical way to unlock the entire tech tree is to
        always choose the cheapest unlockable technologies. These changes and the
        introduction of 17 new technologies have the effect of creating a significantly
        longer end game and it is therefore recommended you disable the turn limit
        when creating a new game.<br></span></p>

        <p><strong>Combat:</strong></p>

        <p>Both
        naval, land and air units have been added and existing units are tweaked
        to achieve a longer more satisfying end game experience. The naval unit''s
        role progressively gets more important as the era advances with longer attack
        and bombardment ranges. Combat has been been made more interesting with new
        rock scissor paper mechanics between the classes. For example, Submarines
        are more effective versus Battleship, Destroyers are more effective versus
        Submarines and Battleship are more effective versus Destroyers. <span style="font-size:
        1em; font-weight: 400;">Classes now progress through identifiable WW1, WW2,
        Cold War en Stealth era generation, making it feel more historically accurate.
        The early (WW1) units have reduced strategic resource requirements, making
        them more likely to appear in combat. <br></span></p>

        <p><em>Strategic
        Resource cost and Construction:</em></p>

        <p>A major difference from
        vannilla human kind is in way how the cost of advanced unit is determined,
        which is no longer static but also depends on the sufficient avaialbility
        of strategic resoures, while minimizing the the minimum strategic resource
        amount. This mean that units will be accesable easier for both player and
        AI and will be easier to upgrade, but at increase construction cost or gold
        price (up to doubl the base cost).</p>
