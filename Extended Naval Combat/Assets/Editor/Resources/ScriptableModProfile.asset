      value: Introduces 20 modern military units and 13 new technologies to create
        a longer, more interesting and historically accurate end game experience

    descriptionAsHTML:
      value: '<p>The goal of this mod is to create a longer, more interesting, and
        realistic end game experience with 20 units and tweaks to existing combat
        units. I tried to make this mod as compatible as possible with other mods
        by putting most new units and bonuses spread over 13 new Technologies, and
        no changes to any cultures, or civics. The new Technologies also help to
        make the Industrial and Contemporary Era last longer, especially the late
        Industrial and early Contemporary era (WW1/WW2) period with 10 technologies.
        To make technology beelining less effective, many of the optional technologies
        give bonuses to late-game naval combat Units. Nuclear weapons have become
        more useful (with increased range) and accessible (with reduced Uranium strategic
        resource requirement) and the addition of a true ICBM weapon (unlocked after
        ICBM Test). The state of Nuclear weapons proliferation is made more intuitive
        as the National Nuclear Weapon Test Programs strategic resource requirements
        are made the same as the missile weapons they unlock, meaning if someone
        manages to build a nuclear weapon test project (including ICBM weapon test),
        they can also build and use them (given they also constructed a missile silo).
        To help get a more natural Science progression, research cost until the early
        modern age has been slightly reduced and starts to increase in the industrial
        era up to double the cost for the end game technologies.</p>
